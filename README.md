Custom icons for ios through webapp hackery

By creating a ios webapp with deeplinks to ios Apps, it appears possible to create custom icon "webapp links" to your existing apps.

How neat is that?

## Notes

Generated files for github pages:
- dist/ - the app pages for this
- index.html - the directory

This implementation is only tested and geared towards iOS 9.

## TODO

- [] Research Android [App Links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/index.html)
- [] Research iOS [Universal Links](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Conceptual/AppSearch/UniversalLinks.html)
